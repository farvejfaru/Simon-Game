# 🎮 Simon Game - JavaScript Implementation

## 📌 About the Project

The **Simon Game** is a memory-based game where players must **repeat a sequence** of colors shown by the game. The sequence gets **longer with each correct response**, making the game more challenging over time.

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, demonstrating **DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic**.
